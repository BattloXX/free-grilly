# Grilly+ DIY unit — hardware (WIP)

Status: **work in progress**, hardware only. Firmware support (a `diy` build variant) gets its own
design later; nothing here changes the Grilleye firmware. Not linked from the README.

Goal: a standalone 8-probe thermometer that behaves like a Grilleye — screen, buzzer, one button,
battery with fuel gauge, "off" = deep sleep — built from off-the-shelf modules on perfboard.

## Decisions so far

| Topic | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Probe readout | 2× ADS1115 (I²C 0x48 / 0x49), 4 channels each | Cheap common modules, 16-bit, no mux, 2 wires. Fit only one for a 4-probe build; firmware will detect which ones answer. |
| Divider supply | LM4040A 2.5 V shunt reference | Readings don't drift as the battery drains. |
| Divider resistor | 10 kΩ 0.1 % per channel (same value as the Grilleye) | Good resolution up to ~300 °C; meat temperatures land mid-range. |
| Probes | Grilleye probes (100 kΩ NTC, β 4250) by default; any NTC via the custom probe type | Grilly+ already supports custom probe types. |
| Display | ST7565 128×64 LCD, SPI, PWM backlight | Same controller family as the Grilleye; readable in sunlight. |
| Board | DFRobot FireBeetle 2 ESP32-E (DFR0654) | Built-in LiPo charger + USB-C; ~13–25 µA deep sleep once the low-power pad is cut. A generic DevKit draws mA in deep sleep. |
| Power | 18650 + MAX17048 fuel gauge; off = deep sleep (like the Grilleye); switched peripheral rail; master slide switch for storage | Existing power button / auto-off / low-battery-cutoff behaviour carries over. |

 I²C (GPIO21 SDA / GPIO22 SCL): ADS1115 0x48, ADS1115 0x49, MAX17048 0x36
```

All I²C pull-ups sit on the switched rail, so nothing back-feeds an unpowered chip in deep sleep.

## Circuits

### Probe channel (×8)

```
 VREF 2.5V ──[10k 0.1%]──┬──────────────── ADS1115 AINx
                         │                    │
                         ├── jack tip      [100nF]
                         │                    │
 GND ────────────────────┴── jack sleeve ─────┴── GND
```

- Probe is ground-referenced (sleeve = GND), so the probe's metal side is at ground.
- Empty jack: the input sits at the full 2.5 V → "disconnected", the same logic as today.
- Expected voltages with a Grilleye probe: 0 °C ≈ 2.43 V, 25 °C ≈ 2.27 V, 55 °C ≈ 1.83 V,
  250 °C ≈ 53 mV (≈ 6–7 ADC counts per °C at PGA ±4.096 V, so still fine).
- Use PGA ±4.096 V (125 µV/LSB); ±2.048 V would clip everything below ~5 °C.
- 2.5 mm **stereo (TRS)** panel jacks, tip + sleeve wired, ring unconnected: they accept both TS and TRS
  plugs. *Verify on a Grilleye probe with a multimeter which contacts carry the NTC.*

### Reference

```
 RAIL 3V3 ──[270 Ω]──┬── VREF (2.5 V) ── to all 8 dividers
                     │
               LM4040AIZ-2.5 (cathode on VREF)   + 10µF + 100nF to GND
                     │
                    GND
```

- Worst-case load (all 8 probes at 250 °C) ≈ 2 mA; 270 Ω keeps the LM4040 in regulation down to a
  3.2 V rail. Idle, the LM4040 sinks ~3 mA — that's why it sits on the switched rail.
- A grade (0.1 %) ≈ 0.25 °C error at room temperature; C grade (0.5 %) ≈ 1.2 °C (fixable with the
  per-probe calibration offset, but A grade is worth the extra euro).

### Peripheral rail switch

- AO3401A P-MOSFET (SOT-23 on a DIP adapter): source = 3V3, drain = RAIL, gate = GPIO26 with 100 kΩ to 3V3.
- GPIO26 low = rail on. At boot and in deep sleep (pin held high) the rail is off.
- Logic-level at 3.3 V gate drive; no extra transistor needed.

### LCD backlight and buzzer

- Both via an NPN (BC337 / S8050) low-side switch, 1 kΩ base resistor from the GPIO.
- Backlight: check whether the LCD module has its own LED series resistor; if not, add one
  (target ~20 mA).
- Buzzer: a **passive** buzzer / magnetic transducer (the firmware plays tones, not on/off), 3 V type,
  with a 1N4148 flyback diode across it. Power it from 3V3.

### Power button

- Momentary switch between GPIO35 and GND, 100 kΩ pull-up to 3V3 (always-on), optional 100 nF across
  the switch for debounce.

### Battery and charging

- One protected 18650 in a holder → master slide switch → FireBeetle PH2.0 battery connector.
- MAX17048 CELL sense on the switched-side battery line, so it tracks the cell whenever the unit
  isn't in storage.
- Charging through the FireBeetle's USB-C. The charging current is fixed by the board (check the
  DFRobot wiki); a 3000 mAh cell will take several hours.
- Rough runtime: 12–20 h with WiFi and backlight on. Deep sleep: ~30 µA total → years.

### FireBeetle prep

- **Cut the low-power pad** (the thin trace marked on the board) to get deep sleep from ~2 mA down to
  ~13–25 µA. After that the onboard RGB LED only works on USB power.

## Practical notes

- Keep the unit away from the lid/firebox: LCD and Li-ion cells don't like > 60 °C.
- Keep the probe wiring on the perfboard short and away from the LCD backlight and buzzer lines.
- Solder the ADS1115 ADDR pin: first module to GND (0x48), second to VDD (0x49). Check the module's
  default (some have ADDR pulled to GND on-board).
- Before putting it in a box: check VREF (2.50 V), rail on/off, and each channel's voltage with a
  known resistor (100 kΩ ≈ 2.27 V).

## Open questions

- The exact ST7565 module (and which U8g2 driver matches it) — decide once a module is picked.
- Grilleye probe jack contacts (TS vs TRS) — measure.
- The ADS1115 input impedance (a few MΩ) against a 10 kΩ source gives ~0.1–0.2 % error; this can be
  corrected in firmware or with the calibration offset. Check on real hardware.
- The FireBeetle charging current and whether it allows charging while the unit is on (load
  sharing).
- Enclosure and panel layout.
- Firmware: separate design (build variant, hardware layer, ADS1115/MAX17048 drivers, pin map).
